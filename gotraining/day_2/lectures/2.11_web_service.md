# Building a Web Service

GOTO Live example web_service

## Your turn...

### Lab2.11.1 ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon24.png "Lab2.11.1") 
---

### Mission

> Write a Web Service to convert roman to arabic and vice versa. 
> The service output should be a JSON document with the following fields:
> o status : http response code
> o number: the arabic number
> o url: the url to run the inverse converter 
ie if roman was requested formulate the arabic conversion url or vice versa.

### Expectations

```shell
curl -XGET http://localhost:3000/roman?n=10 => {"status":200,"arabic_number":10,"roman_numeral":"X","url":"http://localhost:8080/arabic?g=X"}
curl -XGET http://localhost:3000/arabic?g=X => {"status":200,"arabic_number":10,"roman_numeral":"X","url":"http://localhost:8080/roman?n=10"}
```

## Web Service API

## Your turn...

### Lab11.2 ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon24.png "Lab11.2") 
---

### Mission
> Write an API client backed by the WebService you've just wrote. That is reuse the exact same calls as we did in 
> the roman to arabic converter but now by calling your DialARoman Web service.
> ExtraCredit - call your classmate DialARoman Web Service ;-)

### Directions

```shell
go run main.go # Starts your webserver on port 3000
```

### Expectations

```go
ToRoman(10) -> X # => by calling http://localhost:3000/roman?n=10
ToArabic("X") -> 10 # => by calling http://localhost:3000/arabic?g=X
```
