# Testing GO Applications

## Greetings package

> Live coding a new package from the ground up

## TLDR;
* Testing framework is built-in
* Once again no fluff here. given/then, expectations, etc...
* Test file for fred.go is fred_test.go
* Test code lives along side your code in the same folder
* Table testing is the idiomatic way

## The code

```go
# greet.go
package greetings

const format = "Hello, my name is `%s!"

func greet(name string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(format, name)
}
```

## The test

```go
# greet_test.go
package greetings

func TestGreet(t *testing.T) {
    var (
      expected = fmt.Sprintf(format, "Fernand")
      actual   = greetings.greet("Fernand")
    )

    if actual != expected {
        t.Fatalf("Expecting `%s` but got `%s`", expected, actual)
    }
}
```

## Running tests

```shell
go test             # Runs all tests in cwd
go test -v          # Runs all tests in cwd and prints out test info
go test ./...       # Runs all tests including sub packages 
go test --run Greet # Runs all tests with Greet in their name
```

NOTE: Watch out for -run make sure your run verbose to make sure you match the test.

## Automated Testing Tips

Use some kind of tool to automatically run your tests. Guard/reflex/...

### Using reflex
```shell
go get github.com/cespare/reflex
reflex -g '*.go' go test
```

### Table Tests

Table testing is the preferred way to iterate thru a list of use cases for a given set of tests.

NOTE: We need to introduce a few new concepts that we will cover soon. For now bare with me!
```go
// Defines a user defined type named tuple of type struct
type useCase struct {
	// value is a member of useCase of type integer
	value int
	// expectation is a member of useCase of type integer
	expectation int
}

// Create an array of 2 use cases that we want to test
var useCases = [2]useCase{
	// Creates a tuple of type useCase who's value is 1 and expectation is 10
	{1, 10},
	// Creates a tuple of type useCase who's value is 2 and expectation is 20
	{2, 20},
	// NOTE: Trailing coma!
}

func fred(i int) int {
	return i
}

func TestFred(t *testing.T) {
	// Iterates thru an array of test cases
    // The range built-in function takes in an iterable type and returns 2 values: the index and it's associated item
	for _, tuple := range useCases {
        // Pull the value member of the tuple and assigns it
		actual := fred(tuple.value)
        // Pull the expectation of the tuple and assign it
		expected := tuple.expectation

        // Checks if the function returned an expectation
		if actual != expected {
            // If not fail the test!
			t.Fatalf("Use case %v expected %v but got %v", tuple.value, expected, actual)
		}
	}
}
```
