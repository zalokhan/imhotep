# Vendoring

GO does not deal with dependency management. 

```shell
# Latest!
go get -u github.com/fred/killerlib
```

* What if I've used and test killerlib v 1.5.0 locally? 
* What happens when my team mates, pulls my application? 
* What version would they be using?

As of 1.5 Go introduced *$GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT* which allowed go to find dependencies in project local **vendor**
directory first before looking into local workspace in $GOPATH.

## Many players

## Building a package

List package contains a bunch of utilities to work with slices.
Dependency [errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors) 

```shell
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd list
godep save ./...
```

### Automated testing

I use reflex, but many others guard, etc...

[Reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex)

```shell
reflex -g '*.go' go test
```

### Happy as a Hippo?

NOTE: Using CI tools this is great. Install godep as part of your configuration. Then run test automation using godep cli

```shell
godep save ./...
godep go test
# Visit Godeps dir
git commit 'All good here'
```

### Package updates

```shell
go get -u "github.com/pkg/errors"
godep update "github.com/pkg/errors"
```
