# Game Of Thrones

## Lab

> Game of Thrones is all about castles and their castles minions.
> Write a function that takes an array of castles and an array of minions and
> associates minions to castles (essentially zipping the array together) and returns
> that array. You can make the assumption that both array are of the same size.

## Expectations

[{"Castle Black", "melissandre"}, {"Red Keep", "Jon Snow"}, {"DragonStone", "Kal Drogo"}]
