# Fizzbuzz

## Lab

> In the game of FizzBuzz, children count up from 1. If the number is a multiple of 3, they say **Fizz**.
> For multiple of 5, they say **Buzz**. For multiple of both they say **FizzBuzz**. Otherwise they say the number. 
> Write an application, that takes in a number from the command line and computes the Fizzbuzz terms from 0 up to that number.
