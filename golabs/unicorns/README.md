# Unicorn Game

> Create a program where players get to exchange unicorns over an
> unbuffered channel. The game ends once either of the parties gets "randomly" seek and
> tired of playing that game ;-).

## Expectations

```
<- [Faranouch] received Unicorn(0)
-> [Faranouch] sending Unicorn(1)
<- [Norbert] received Unicorn(1)
-> [Norbert] sending Unicorn(2)
<- [Faranouch] received Unicorn(2)
-> [Faranouch] sending Unicorn(3)
<- [Norbert] received Unicorn(3)
-> [Norbert] sending Unicorn(4)
<- [Faranouch] received Unicorn(4)
-> [Faranouch] sending Unicorn(5)
<- [Norbert] received Unicorn(5)
-> [Norbert] sending Unicorn(6)
<- [Faranouch] received Unicorn(6)
-> [Faranouch] sending Unicorn(7)
<- [Norbert] received Unicorn(7)
Norbert is B.O.R.E.D!!
